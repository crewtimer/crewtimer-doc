# Finish-Line Camera Alignment Procedure

**Goal:** Align the camera so the finish line stays locked on the far marker at all zoom levels and matches the physical guide wire/string.

---

## Preparation
- Place a **far marker** *exactly* on the physical finish line, on the same vertical plane.
- Run a **guide wire or string** along the finish line in front of the camera position.  Check with plumb line or level.

>Parallax Warning: The guide wire should be placed in the same vertical plane as the far marker and as far from the camera as practical. If the guide wire is too close, its apparent position will shift with camera angle and zoom, making alignment inaccurate.

## Step 1 – Tilt Alignment

1. Mount the camera and set initial position and pan angle so it’s roughly aimed at the guide wire and far marker by eye.
2. Adjust the **camera side tilt** so the far marker appears vertical in the image. A small level can be handy for adjusting side tilt.
3. Adjust the **camera forward tilt** so the finish area of interest is roughly in the center of the zoomed out image.
4. **Lock tilt and mount** before making further adjustments.

## Step 2 – Rough Alignment with Guide Wire

1. Zoom in until the far marker is visible.
2. Adjust exposure so both the guide wire and marker are visible.
3. Slide or reposition the camera horizontally along the mounting surface (rail, beam, tripod base) until the guide wire and far marker are overlapping.  They do not have to be in the exact center of the image but should be near if the inital mounting was close.

## Step 3 – Optical Centerline Calibration (Lens–Sensor Offset)
> Ensures the finish line doesn’t shift relative to the far marker when zooming.  **Ignore the guide wire during this step.**

### Initial Calibration
1. Zoom out.
2. Move the finish line in the image to the center of the recording frame.
3. Pan until the finish line aligns with the far marker.

### Iterative Fine-Tune

> Do not adjust pan for this process
1. Zoom out and note where the finish line is relative to the far marker.  
   - If not exactly on the marker, pick a **reference spot A** (a feature near the marker).
2. Zoom in and observe if the finish line shifts relative to spot A.  
   - If it shifts **right**, adjust the finish line so the finish line moves **right** about **25% of the observed error**.  
   - If it shifts **left**, move it **left** by 25% of the error.
3. Repeat until zooming in/out produces **minimal movement** between the finish line and spot A.

**Result:** The finish line’s offset from the image center now compensates for lens–sensor alignment error.

## Step 4 – Final Pan Angle Centering

At this point the guide wire or string and far marker should still be in alignment.  This final adjustment will adjust the pan angle of the camera for alignment of all three elements.

1. Pan the camera so the finish line aligns with the **far marker** and the **guide wire**.  
   - If there’s a conflict, prioritize **far marker accuracy**.
3. Save the preset in the recording software.

## Step 5 – Final Checks
- Zoom fully in and out — the finish line should stay locked on the far marker.
- Lock down all tripod/camera adjustments.
