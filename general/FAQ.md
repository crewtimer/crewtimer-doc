| What is the '?' button for on CrewTimer mobile?              | The question mark is for cases where you can't determine the bow number immediately but need to record one or more time events.  Once you press '?' a time event is recorded and you can subsequently edit the bow number for the time event by touching it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Can I hook up an external button for timing events?          | Yes, you can hook up an external button to assist with recording timing events.  When an external button is used, the timing events are recorded on the button press and pressing bow numbers on the mobile device will match up to the recorded time events.  This is particularly helpful for close finishes.   A bluetooth clicker button is available from the [CrewTimer store](https://admin.crewtimer.com/store).                                                                                                   |
| What if I accidently record an timestamp?                    | Just tap the trash-can delete icon and mark the event as deleted.  Any timestamps recorded by CrewTimer can be deleted in this manner.  Deleted timestamps can also be restored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| How do I assess a penalty?                                   | Press and hold the bow number and select from either a standard penalty or a custom penalty used by your regatta. Your 'Station Type' must include Penalties.

| What if a boat does not finish or start?                     | You can press and hold the bow number to bring up a Penalty/Status form for that boat.  In this form you can mark the boat as DNS or DNF. Your 'Station Type' must include Penalties.  See Settings->Station Type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| What if a race needs to be restarted?                        | Simply 'delete' the start timestamp for the race from the mobile app and record a new time when the race starts.  You can also check the 'ignore' column for the start time from the admin web interface via the 'Adjust Results' view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| What if a boat scratches?                                    | You can press and hold the bow number and assess a custom ‘scratch’ penalty.  This will show on the website and any times associated with the bow will be hidden. A boat can also be scratched by setting the 'Status' column to 'Scratch' in the configuration spreadsheet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| How can I disqualify a boat?                                 | You can press and hold the bow number and assess a custom ‘dq’ penalty.  The DQ will be shown on the website  and any times associated with the bow will be hidden.  In fact, any code starting with DQ will trigger a DQ result. Your 'Station Type' must include Penalties.  See Settings->Station Type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| What is the 'Official' button shown for each event used for? | This will change the online results page for the event from 'Provisional' to 'Official'. Your 'Station Type' must include Penalties.  See Settings->Station Type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Can I include additional timing waypoints?                   | Yes, the admin page allows configuration of multiple timing waypoints as well as computed waypoints that are calculated from other waypoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| What do the background colors of the timestamp mean?         | Yellow/Orange indicates that the timing event has not been communicated to the CrewTimer cloud server.   Blue indicates the timestamp has been recorded in the cloud.  A red indicator means that there is a communication problem to the cloud, most likely due to poor 3G coverage.  This will automatically correct itself when communication is restored.  In any case.  all timing events are stored in persistent storage in the mobile device and will be communicated to the cloud server as soon as possible.     |
| Can CrewTimer be used for multi-day regattas?                | Yes, the configuration spreadsheet can specify a ‘Day’ column to configure events for each day.  This field could also be used for AM,PM or any other segmentation desired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| What happens if I exit the app?                              | If you exit the app, all timing events are retained.  When the app restarts, any pending timing events will be communicated to the cloud server. When using the Bluetooth clicker, times will be retained in the clicker and communicated to the app when it restarts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Can I modify the spreadsheet after a regatta starts?         | Yes, you can add entries, delete entries, and make any changes you like.  However, any entries for which there is already a time event recorded will be retained regardless of changes you make to the spreadsheet.   When you change the spreadsheet, CrewTimer will not update until you click the 'Refresh Lineups' action button.  Any connected mobile devices are also notified of the lineup change and the mobile UI will update as will any connected web clients viewing [www.crewtimer.com](www.crewtimer.com). |
| Can I export results to a spreadsheet?                       | Yes, you can download csv results via the data export url.  The URL is of the form [https://www.crewtimer.com/results?asfile=true&regatta=](https://www.crewtimer.com/results?regatta=)&lt;yourmobileid>.  Save as a csv file such a results.csv.  Excel will open this as a spreadsheet. You can also select the 'Export Results' action on your regatta from the admin panel. To download results as JSON, append &lt;format=json                                                                                        |
| How do I generate a heat sheet?                              | For sprint races a heat sheet can be downloaded via the 'Export Heatsheet' action on your regatta from the admin panel. This downloads a CSV file which you can format as you wish for printing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
