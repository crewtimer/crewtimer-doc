# Video processing with CrewTimer Connect

## Introduction

The CrewTimer Connect module provides the ability to process finish line recordings in a format created by CrewTimer Recorder or RiaB Camera. These recordings combine video and timestamps for accurate evaluation of the finishes. 

CrewTimer Connect makes processing the results highly efficient by integrating "hints" from other CrewTimer stations into the Workflow.

It's strongly recommended to test the full suite of hardware, software and volunteers before your actual regatta. Although the overall process is not complicated, it's more involved then operating a clicker.

## Getting started

You will need to download and installed the CrewTimer Connect software from here (Windows, Mac). These links will always take you to the latest version available. It's recommended you update the software as part of the preparation for your regatta.

You can determine the current version you are running by clicking the three lines at the top right of your Connect window -> About. A window will show you the current version.

## Configuration

There is a few setups steps to complete before you can process results. You will need to complete these steps before each regatta.

You will need the regattas **MobileID** and **MobilePIN** from the administration website.
