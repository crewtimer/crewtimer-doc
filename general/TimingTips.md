# Timing Tips

CrewTimer works best with two timers at the start and two to three at the finish.  For sprint races, use of two-step timing via either the built-in ‘Add SPLIT’ app button or an external button is recommended to be able to record multiple events quickly.  Finish timers should practice recording multiple time events quickly before the regatta starts.  Use of two-step timing can also be used for starts and head race finishes as desired.

## Two-Step Timing

Using two-step timing is recommended for finish timing to allow very quick and accurate recording of timestamps. Two-step timing is done with CrewTimer by either using the external timing button or by enabling the ADD SPLIT button in the mobile UI.  Pressing either the external button or the ADD SPLIT mobile UI button will add a time event without any association to a particular race or bow number.  Pressing bow numbers will then associate the bow number with the first available unassigned time event.

The following sequence would be a suggested two-step timing procedure:

1. A judge calls Mark as each boat crosses the finish.
2. At the Mark call, either the external button or ADD SPLIT button in the UI is pressed to record each Mark event.  If the line judge has the timing button in hand, timing accuracy is enhanced.
3. The finish order is recorded on paper as a running journal.  E.g. 44, 46, 43 or 3, 2, 4.
4. When time permits, the finish bow numbers are matched to the available split times recorded previously.

## Head Race Timing

### Head Race Start Timing

For the start, one person can call out bow numbers as boats approach the start and a 2nd person can press the bow number as the starting beep is sounded.  This is often done by a single person for head races.

### Head Race Finish Timing

Jobs: Finish order journal recording, line judge calling mark, tablet operator.

* For the finish, timers should agree on bow numbers approaching the finish and record finish order for all shells on a piece of paper.   E.g. 40, 42, 41. For close finishes, note relationship such as 40 inside, 42 outside as they approach the finish.   The race official can then call the finish by saying ‘outside then inside’ without having to know bow numbers.  If a stopwatch is used for backup, annotate each bow number on the finish order journal with a time.
* Record each finish time at the finish horn by pressing the remote button or use the ADD SPLIT button (or use ‘?’ if two-step timing is not enabled).
* The finish order recorded by the timers is then used to associate a bow number with the recorded time.

## Sprint Race Timing

### Sprint Race Start Timing

For the start, one person can press a bow number for the event as the starting beep is sounded.  This is often done by a single person.

### Sprint Race Finish Timing

* For the finish, recording order of finish is critical.  This is usually done by a referee calling out lane numbers as the finish horn is sounded.
* Record each finish time at the finish horn by pressing the external button or ADD SPLIT button.
* The finish order recorded by the other timers is then used to associate a bow number with the recorded time.
